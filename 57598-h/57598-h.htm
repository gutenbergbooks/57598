<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>There is to me something typically American
about the life-story leading up to the play contained
in this volume—a story in which the creation
and publication of that play will undoubtedly represent
only a temporary climax. I want to tell it, not only as
a curiosity, but as something that has genuine significance
to the world of letters. The meaning of this
story, read in conjunction with the work that has
grown out of it, is that the time when books were
bred by books only is about gone now. The new
literature will come straight out of life, apparently,
and will in consequence have made a decided gain, even
though it may have lost something else. As it springs
forth, full-blooded and ready-tongued, we shall undoubtedly
hear melancholy voices proclaim the <i>vulgarization</i>
of poetry. But if, on hearing such protests
rising from some anæmic scholar’s cloistered cell, we
look back through the ages and fix our gaze not only
on the little followers but on the great leaders—on
the Dantes and Shakespeares and Cervanteses and
Molières—then we shall find that almost always the
term of opprobrium quoted above has implied a <i>vitalization</i>
of the supposedly menaced art form.</p>

<p>The author of “The Red Light of Mars” is now
in his thirtieth year, having been born on January 7,
1884, in Howard County, Maryland. His father was
a Baltimore merchant and insurance broker, who, in
his turn, had a Confederate blockade runner for father
and an officer in the English army for grandfather.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
His mother sprang from an old French middle-class
family, which had to emigrate from Dijon after the
Edict of Nantes.</p>

<p>George Bronson-Howard studied in a private school
in London, in the public schools of Baltimore, and in
the City College of the same place. At fourteen he
lost both parents, just as he was about to enter Johns
Hopkins University, his age having been carefully concealed
in order that the examinations might be open
to him. Instead he became a messenger in the Weather
Bureau at Baltimore. While thus employed, he submitted
successfully to the first of a series of civil service
examinations, each one of which required some skilful
disingenuousness lest the applicant’s age prove an insuperable
obstacle. During the next seven years, Mr.
Bronson-Howard busied himself successively as follows:</p>

<p>Reporter on the Baltimore <i>American</i>; clerk in the
office of the Secretary of the Navy; stenographer at
the Brooklyn Navy Yard; reporter on the Brooklyn
<i>Citizen</i>; press representative for one of the Frohman
theatres and for one of George W. Lederer’s productions;
reporter on the New York <i>Herald</i>; clerk in
the Bureau of Navigation at Washington; clerk in the
office of the Collector of Customs at Manila, Philippine
Islands; assistant to the Collector of Customs at Iloilo,
on the island of Panay; newspaper correspondent at
Manila; member of the Philippine Constabulary; contributor
of fiction stories to various newspapers and
magazines; employé of the Imperial Chinese Customs
Service at Canton; agent of the Imperial Chinese Government
in Shantung Province; war correspondent for
the London <i>Chronicle</i> with the Russian army in Manchuria;
magazine and newspaper writer at San
Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span></p>

<p>He was twenty-one when he came East and began to
produce a series of clever, quick-moving stories, designated
by himself “as melodramatic magazine yarns.”
The type of hero around which they were built was
wholly new: a secret agent of the State Department.
Appearing in book form under the title of “Norroy,
Diplomatic Agent,” those stories met with such success
that their author found himself relieved for a
long time from all necessity of “pot-boiling.”</p>

<p>Since then he has written more stories, three romances—one
of which so far has only been published
in Germany—essays, plays, criticism, musical <i>revues</i>,
etc. He has acted as play reader for the late Henry B.
Harris, as dramatic editor on <i>Smith’s Magazine</i>, as
dramatic critic on the New York <i>Morning Telegraph</i>,
as vaudeville impresario at Paris, and as librettist for
the Winter Garden at New York. He has dramatized
a novel and novelized a play. He has lived at London,
Baltimore, New York, Paris, and Nice—to settle down
at last in a house of his own at Belleterre, Port Jefferson,
Long Island.</p>

<p>So far Mr. Bronson-Howard has a dozen plays of
every conceivable type to his credit, some of them being
wholly his own and some being written in collaboration
with others. Most of these works have already been
produced, some with marked success, and others are
scheduled for performance in the immediate future.
Thus, for instance, “The Red Light of Mars” will be
staged by H. H. Frazee during the season of 1913-14.</p>

<p>There are two qualities that seem to characterize all
of Mr. Bronson-Howard’s dramatic productions: a
keen perception of the demands and possibilities of
the stage, and a shrewdly humorous grasp of human
nature. His command of stagecraft is so facile that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
at times it strikes the critic as a danger to his art.
And it has the faults as well as the merits generally
accompanying such facility. He would probably be
much surprised if he heard himself referred to as a
“psychologist”—and yet that is just what he is, in
his own practical, intuitive, American way. With these
two qualities, which provide for the framework of his
art, goes, as its informing and directing spirit, a strong
inclination to “side with the under dog.”</p>

Critty opens the door for Fanny Felix, her mother,
Mrs. Felix, John Magnus, and William Tromper.
Fanny is, par excellence, the well-bred, cold, detached,
sure-of-herself American girl of the upper class,
very lace-y and lingerie-y. Mrs. Felix looks almost
as juvenile; she has less dignity; her coat-collar
and tie might be a man’s; her smart hat is feminine
enough, and so are her small, high-heeled shoes. John
Magnus has an air and an eyeglass; wears a morning
coat, vest, and trousers of light gray, and a gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
top-hat to match; needs only a pair of binoculars
slung over his shoulder to be attired for the races.
William Tromper is the vulgar, pig-headed, ignorant,
self-made American business man. His small
pig-like eyes show sullen hatred, an animal’s cunning,
and a savage’s determination. He is continually
ready to assert authority over supposed inferiors
and equality with superiors: the breed that has made
America infamous. He is dressed in that stiff supposed-to-be-correct
fashion that marks such people:
a suit of expensive but ugly, hard-faced cloth, pressed
into knife-like creases about the lapels and trousers;
a shining white waistcoat, starched and creased; a
hard-boiled shirt; a mathematically perfect rhomboid
of a sausage-like necktie; shining, creaky laced
shoes of patent leather, etc. When the party enters,
and during the first few words of the following conversation,

Though he has no authority in the matter—the warrants
being in the Lieutenant’s hands—Peattie feels
called upon to protest in the name of civic dignity,

reported, even at that—very unjustly—that
Faust affair. Those stupid Germans—when they’re
not drinking themselves into sentimental poetry, the
ravings of a disordered brain, they’re guzzling
themselves into gloomy philosophy—the pessimism
of a disordered liver—and the fellow who wrote up
the Faust-Marguerite case had both maladies (<i>viciously</i>)
in their most virulent form! And that’s
what most humans get their idea of me from—when,
actually, the case was just about like this one—(<i>meditatively</i>)

your own youthful dreams. Here is the fiery pit—here!
But you are the Devils, and I am the tortured
soul. You are the flames—I am the burning body.
Yes, you:—for here is where Devils rule—this
Earth is Hell! (<i>At the window, his hands outstretched</i>)
Here I am debased, my sullen angers
stirred, my soul held back from the Sun by inhuman
humans who spend their lives stanching a pretty
woman’s tears, while a hundred thousand fellow-creatures
die for the want of a pound of summer ice,
a basket of winter fuel! You: who worship a Man
of Peace, and make bloody war in His Name; who
worship a Prince of Purity, and wed the women of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
your lust in His Name; who worship a Poor
Man’s Christ, and in the same breath those who
steal the Poor Man’s Bread—in His Name.
(<i>Looks up to the sky</i>) You said I had ruled long
enough, Crucified One! So you came to do through
men’s Love what I had done through men’s Hate,
Lust and Greed. So you died for men, and
thereafter men called hate Anger Against The
Heathen; lust—the Woman Leading Them to
Holier Things; greed—World Conquest in your
Name. (<i>Drops on his knees</i>) I see you ever, Son
of the Sun, sad and weary in that bright star of
your exile; hoping against hope that a stray seed
sown two thousand years ago may yet bring men to
wisdom through Love. While I still go on among
them to bring them to Wisdom through Understanding,
teaching them that Ignorance and Hate bring
no gain—the only reasoning they can understand.
And so sustained by you in your lonely star, while
you shine on hoping men will look up, ever up—I
work bitterly among them here below—until I
have won Wisdom for them and Freedom for us;
freedom that we may go on to our Father, the Sun,
we two Exiles; Star of the Morning, and Red
Light of Mars! (<i>While speaking thus, he seems

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
